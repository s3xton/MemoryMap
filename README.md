# MemoryMap

Android application for CMPS 121 final project. We developed an asynchronous location-based not-sharing app.
Users can post a message or picture to their current location for others to see. The message is permanently tied to that
location. Users are given a map view of their surroundings with notes marked on the map, but they can only read the notes
they are within 50m of.
